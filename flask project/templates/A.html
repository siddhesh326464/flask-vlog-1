        <h1>Accelaration due to gravity</h1>
        <p>When we release the ball from a specific height to the ground, it accelerates downward due to gravity force. Suppose there are no other types of forces acting on a falling ball other than gravity. In that case, it drops with a constant gravitational acceleration value of 9.8 m/s2, which is determined by Newtonâ€™s laws.  </p>
        <h4>Case 1</h4>
        <p>When we throw the ball horizontally along the ground, its velocity continuously increases, except it disturbs other objects. If we keep a ball before throwing, its velocity is zero. It begins increasing after it is released towards the ground. The greater the height from ball release, the faster the it will travel.</p>
